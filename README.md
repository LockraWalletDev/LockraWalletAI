# LockraWallet

An AI-informed wallet system designed to **protect, monitor, and react**  
Built on Solana. Hardened by design. Lightweight by nature.

---

## 🧭 Principles

- **Security-first**: all actions require user intent. No automation of execution.  
- **Clarity over noise**: present only meaningful signals, not raw data.  
- **On-chain alignment**: interpret what’s happening, not what might.  

---

## 🧠 Behavior

Lockra watches wallet states and token flows in real time.  
When something shifts — volume, velocity, sender fingerprint — it reacts.

You’re alerted.  
With context.  
With reasoning.  
But always with choice.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

- UI: React + TypeScript  
- Wallet Layer: Solana Web3.js  
- AI Logic: Transfer risk scoring + anomaly tags (Python)  
- Delivery: Chrome Extension runtime  
- No custody. No key storage.

## ⛓ Boundaries

Lockra does **not**:  
- Store private keys  
- Automatically initiate transfers  
- Make financial recommendations

Lockra **does**:  
- Analyze historical behavior  
- Spot irregular token patterns  
- Surface real-time warnings you can trust

✔ a readable wallet state
